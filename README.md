# Manilla
A portfolio of work, small and big.

Context will be provided for projects, as well as a date, and other relevant information.
Code will be (hopefully) somewhat readable and commented. If a project was a one-off I won't put too much effort into documentation.

Works here are not final and will be updated as I make progress, updates and commits will be well documented, no matter how small the change.
Code still in progress will have a "wip" in their filename.
