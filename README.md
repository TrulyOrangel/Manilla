# Manilla
A portfolio of work, small and big.

Context will be provided for projects, as well as a date, and other relevant information.
Code will be (hopefully) somewhat readable and commented. If a project was a one-off I won't put too much effort into documentation.
The small works are just files that aren't major things, but still interesting enough to put out. This can include interesting code problems, code used for projects I worked on, and other things I consider 'small'. Generally I'll write about what I learned in these small projects.

Works here are not final and will be updated as I make progress, updates and commits will be well documented, no matter how small the change.
Code still in progress will have a "wip" in their filename.
